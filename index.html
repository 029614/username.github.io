          <h2>Looking to Crew Up?</h2>
          <p>As a recent graduate from Thinkful's online full stack developer's course, I'm looking for an opporunity to build my career and secure my future.</p>
          <p>Through my time learning and practicing, I have found that I am particularly fond of building web apps, debugging and Javascript in general. While my talents lay primarily in coding, I am fully qualified in all aspects of web design, both back end and front end.</p>
          <p>As a fledgling web developer, I should like to work on challenging projects, in order to further hone my skills and advance my knowledge.</p>

            <img class="history-image" src="https://i.imgur.com/668avTK.jpg" alt="A picture of Samuel McClure as a child">
            <p>I was born in Federal Way, Washington, on October 3rd, 1992. When I was three, my family moved back to Alaska, to a town called Nikiski, where I lived until I left home at seventeen. I spent my childhood playing in true wilderness, and grew to become an excellent woodsman and survivalist (It's too bad such skills are irrelevent this century).</p>

            </div>
            <p>For as long as I can remember, I've worked in my Father's cabinet shop. Sweeping, organizing,  gophering (Go for "this"! Go for "that"!), and eventually becoming a competant craftsman myself.</p>

            <p>It's an age old story in an age of age old stories, the one about the kid who thinks he's ready to make his own decisions. Not long after I turned 17, I said goodbye to the parents and left for what would be a stern lesson in reality.</p>
            <p>I found work aboard my cousins fishing boat and spent time commerical fishing in the Gulf of Alaska. This led me to yet another fishing boat which led me ultimately to the United States Merchant Marine.</p>

            <p>In December of 2013, I left home for a seafaring apprenticeship, my ticket to adventure on the high seas. In the four years I spent at sea, I didn't see all that much adventure. Mostly I saw water to the horizon in every direction, and found that life at sea, in this day, is more peaceful then anything. It was all going well until a girl, my now wife, destroyed everything I thought I loved.</p>

            <span>They say the greatest killer of sailors by far is love, and at least in my case, it was true.</span>
            <p> I moved home in 2017 and began sailing aboard ships which worked locally only, in order to be closer to my wife. I had been considering a career in software for many years, even before I had ever left for sea, and a career change was needed. Thats when I tore my ACL and Meniscus.</p>
            <p> The break from work was the perfect excuse to start my new life in software and I quickly signed up for and eventually completed an online bootcamp with <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>.</p>
